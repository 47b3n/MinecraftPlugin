# MinecraftPlugin
Custom Minecraft/spigot plugin with some basic commands and events I am working on.

The name of the plugin is actually ```BasicCoolPlugin``` because I created the repo calling it MinecraftPlugin, but then changed the name of the plugin to ```BasicCoolPlugin```.

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/47b3n/MinecraftPlugin/wiki) on more information about the commands and the events.
